# CIS Image Processing Research Internship

Welcome to my repository for the CIS Image Processing Internship! 
In this internship, I learned a lot about various image processing techniques and how they can be used to enhance images for different applications. In this repository, I will document some of the things I learned, including erosion, dilation, image equalization, and filters such as the Gaussian filter.
