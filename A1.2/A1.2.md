**Different Color Systems.**


**What Is a Color System?**

A color system is a set of colors that represent a specific visual spectrum. These few colors are mixed together to create a limited usable range, and that range is called a color system. Examples of a color system include RGB, CMYK, and Lab.

**Color Models:**

- RGB
- CMY
- HSV 

In Digital Image Processing, the hardware-oriented models that are commonly used are the RGB model for printers and color monitors.

1) **RGB Model:**

![](Aspose.Words.59aec0c9-0c8e-46cc-8d6f-dd5106bd829e.001.png)The RGB model is used when working with digital screen-based designs, such as those viewed on a computer screen or phone display. In the RGB color model, a value between 0 and 255 is assigned to each of the primary colors, Red, Green and Blue, where 0 is dark and 255 is bright. By listing the three values for the red, green, and blue phosphors, you can specify the exact color that will be mixed. It is most common colour model used in Digital image processing and openCV

1) **CMY:**

It is a subtractive colour model. 0 represents the primary colour and 1 represents the lightest colour. In this model, point (1, 1, 1) represents black, and (0,0,0) represents white. It is a subtractive model thus the value is subtracted from 1 to vary from least intense to a most intense colour value.

**-RGB to CYM and Vice versa** 

Color specification using the RGB model is an additive process (Additive color mixing is creating a new color by a process that adds one set of wavelengths to another set of wavelengths).

We begin with black and add on the appropriate primary components to yield a desired color. The concept RGB color model is used in Display monitor. On the other hand, the CMY color model use a subtraction process (creating a new color by the removal of wavelengths from a light with a broad spectrum of wavelengths) and this concept is used in the printer.

In CMY model, we begin with white and take away the appropriate primary components to yield a desired color.

**Example:**

If we subtract red from white, what remains consists of green and blue which is cyan. The coordinate system of CMY model use the three primaries’ complementary colors:

1) [**HSV](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hsl.asp)**:**

![](Aspose.Words.59aec0c9-0c8e-46cc-8d6f-dd5106bd829e.004.png)The image consists of three channels. Hue, Saturation and Value are three channels. This colour model does not use primary colours directly. It uses colour in the way humans perceive them. HSV color when is represented by a cone. 

-Hue represents different colors in different angle ranges. Hue is expressed as a number from 0 to 360 degrees representing hues of red (starts at 0), yellow (starts at 60), green (starts at 120), cyan (starts at 180), blue (starts at 240), and magenta (starts at 300)

\- Saturation is the amount of gray (0% to 100%) in the color.

-Value (or Brightness) represents the intensity of the color chosen. Its value lies in percentage from 0 to 1. 0 is black and 1 is the brightest and reveals the color.
