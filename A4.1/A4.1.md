**Morphological operations:** 

A set of operations that process images based on shapes. They apply a structuring element to an input image and generate an output image.

**Dilation:**

Morphological dilation makes objects more visible and fills in small holes in objects. Lines appear thicker, and filled shapes appear larger.

**Working of dilation:**

1. A kernel is convolved with the image
1. A pixel element in the original image is ‘1’ if at least one pixel under the kernel is ‘1’.
1. It increases the white region in the image, or the size of the foreground object increases.

**Erosion:**

Morphological erosion removes floating pixels and thin lines so that only substantive objects remain. Remaining lines appear thinner, and shapes appear smaller.

Working of erosion: 

1. A kernel is convolved with the image.
1. A pixel in the original image (either 1 or 0) will be considered 1 only if all the pixels under the kernel are 1, otherwise, it is eroded (made to zero).
1. Thus, all the pixels near the boundary will be discarded depending upon the size of the kernel.
1. So, the thickness or size of the foreground object decreases or simply the white region decreases in the image.

**Opening**

The basic effect of an opening is somewhat like erosion in that it tends to remove some of the foreground (bright) pixels from the edges of regions of foreground pixels. However, it is less destructive than erosion in general. The effect of the operator is to preserve foreground regions that have a similar shape to this structuring element, or that can completely contain the structuring element, while eliminating all other regions of foreground pixels. Opening is generally used to remove small objects from the foreground (usually taken as the bright pixels)

The opening operator therefore requires two inputs: an image to be opened, and a structuring element.

**Closing**

Closing is similar in some ways to dilation in that it tends to enlarge the boundaries of foreground (bright) regions in an image (and shrink background color holes in such regions), but it is less destructive of the original boundary shape. Closing is generally used to remove small holes in the foreground, changing small islands of background into foreground.

It is defined simply as a dilation followed by an erosion using the same structuring element for both operations The closing operator therefore requires two inputs: an image to be closed and a structuring element.
