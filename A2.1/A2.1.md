**Filters**

- Filtering is a technique for modifying or enhancing an image. For example, you can filter an image to emphasize certain features or remove other features. 
- Image processing operations implemented with filtering include smoothing, sharpening, and edge enhancement.
- Filtering is a neighborhood operation, in which the value of any given pixel in the output image is determined by applying some algorithm to the values of the pixels about the corresponding input pixel.

**(1). Median Filter** 

![](Aspose.Words.72d61fb2-a272-4c19-9962-7cb8a870a05b.001.png)The median filter considers each pixel in the image in turn and looks at its nearby neighbors to decide whether it is representative of its surroundings. It replaces it with the median of neighboring pixel values.

**(2).** **Mean or Average Filter** 

In average filtering, pixel values will be replaced by average values of neighbor pixels. The calculation of average value is as follows.

**(3). Weighted Average Filter** 

In weighted average filter, we gave more weight to the center value, due to which the contribution of center becomes more than the rest of the values. Due to weighted average filtering, we can control the blurring of image.

It used to blur images. Also, it removes details and noises. Gaussian filter is like mean filter. But main difference is, Gaussian filter use a kernel. That kernel has a shape of gaussian hump. Gaussian kernel weights pixels at its center much more strongly than its boundaries. There are different gaussian kernels. Based on the kernel size, output image will be different.

**(5).** **Frequency Domain Filters** 

used for smoothing and sharpening of image by removal of high or low frequency components. Sometimes it is possible of removal of very high and very low frequency. Frequency domain filters are different from spatial domain filters as it basically focuses on the frequency of the images. Frequency filtering is based on the Fourier Transform. The operator usually takes an image and a filter function in the Fourier domain. This image is then multiplied with the filter function in a pixel-by-pixel fashion:

where F(k,l) is the input image in the Fourier domain, H(k,l) the filter function and G(k,l) is the filtered image. To obtain the resulting image in the spatial domain, G(k,l) has to be re-transformed using the inverse Fourier Transform.

These are of 3 types:
