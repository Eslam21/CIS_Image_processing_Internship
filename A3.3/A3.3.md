## What is the Fourier transform and its use in image processing?**

-It is used to decompose an image into its sine and cosine components. The output of the transformation represents the image in the Fourier or frequency domain, while the input image is the spatial domain equivalent. In the Fourier domain image, each point represents a particular frequency contained in the spatial domain image. The Fourier Transform is used in a wide range of applications, such as image analysis, image filtering, image reconstruction and image compression.

**What are the two most common ways of removing periodic noise in the frequency domain?(<a name="_hlk111030971"></a>notch filter and bandreject)**

-Low pass and high pass filters

**Low pass filters**: Allow passing only low frequency details, attenuates the high frequency details. Example: Smoothening filters.

**High pass filters**: Allows passing only high frequency details, attenuates the low frequency details. Example: Sharpening mask filters.

**Bandreject Filter:**

A Bandreject filtered image can be obtained by adding a Lowpass filtered with a High pass filtered image (at different threshold).

**Notch Filter:**

It is a kind of bandreject/bandpass filter that rejects/passes a very

narrow set of frequencies, around a center frequency.
